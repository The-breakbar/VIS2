			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
				This project implements the paper "Extracting Movement-based Topics for Analysis of Space Use" by G. Andrienko, N. Andrienko, and D. Hecker. The project is
				available at <a href="https://the-breakbar.github.io/VIS2/">https://the-breakbar.github.io/VIS2/</a>.

			<h1>Usage</h1>
			<p>
				The purpose of this visualization method is to analyze spatio-temporal movement patterns using topic modeling. Using data which consists of points in space and time
				(such as cars moving through a city), the data is embedded in a voronoi diagram. This is supposed to support the exploration of spatial and temporal patterns of
				movement, enabling understanding of space use. However, whether this method can uncover such insights, depends on the data and the chosen parameters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The data to be visualized has to be a .csv file in the form <code>"id","datetime","lat","lon"</code>. Two sample datasets are provided, a dataset of car movements
				in Milan, and a smaller version of the same dataset. For the computation, two configuration variables are exposed: the maximum radius of voronoi cells and the
				number of topics for topic modelling. We recommend default values of 2500m and 20 respectively. Computation time can range from 2 to 5 minutes, please be patient.

				The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/The-breakbar/VIS2">https://github.com/The-breakbar/VIS2</a>. The project itself is a static web page
				built with d3.js, webpack and typescript. All computations are done on the client side.
